# Meta-analysis

This repo describes the meta-analysis frameworks I built at the DSI, that served as our core method for evaluating treatment applications in crop management for Damon's lab, benchmarked against a no-treatment control (NTC, i.e., non-treated control). 
These methods supported analyses later published in peer-reviewed outlets.
